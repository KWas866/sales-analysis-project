#🚀 **PySpark Sales Analysis**  

##📌 **Overview**  
This project is a PySpark-based workflow for analyzing sales data. It includes data ingestion, filtering, and exploratory analysis of sales trends across different time periods.  

##📂 **Files**  
📄 `superstore.csv` - Dataset containing sales transaction details.  
📜 `pyspark_sales_project.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with PySpark code for data processing and analysis.  

##🛠 **Requirements**  
✅ Python (3.x)  
✅ Apache Spark & PySpark  

##⚙️ **Setup Instructions**  
1️⃣ Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pyspark
   ```  
2️⃣ Load the `superstore.csv` dataset into your workspace.  
3️⃣ Open `pyspark_sales_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Databricks.  
4️⃣ Run the cells sequentially to process and analyze the data.  

##✨ **Features**  
🔹 Dynamic time filtering (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, Previous Year)  
🔹 Data loading from CSV into a Spark DataFrame  
🔹 Sales trend analysis by category, region, and customer segment  
🔹 SQL queries using SparkSQL for deeper insights  

##📌 **Usage**  
This project serves as a starting point for sales data analysis using PySpark. It can be extended with more advanced analytics, machine learning models, or visualizations.
