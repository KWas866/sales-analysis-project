# 🚀 **PySpark Sales Analysis**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This project is a PySpark-based workflow for analyzing sales data. It includes data ingestion, filtering, and exploratory analysis of sales trends across different time periods.  

## 📂 **Files**  
📄 `superstore.csv` - Dataset containing sales transaction details.  
📜 `pyspark_sales_project.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with PySpark code for data processing and analysis.  

## 🛠 **Requirements**  
✅ Python (3.x)  
✅ Apache Spark & PySpark  

## ⚙️ **Setup Instructions**  
1️⃣ Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pyspark
   ```  
2️⃣ Load the `superstore.csv` dataset into your workspace.  
3️⃣ Open `pyspark_sales_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Databricks.  
4️⃣ Run the cells sequentially to process and analyze the data.  

## 📌 Business Requirements
The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights into sales performance by analyzing key trends and patterns. The business requirements include:

✔️ Sales performance analysis – Identify top-performing categories, regions, and customer segments.<br/>
✔️ Time-based filtering – Analyze sales trends over different time periods (weekly, monthly, yearly, previous year).<br/>
✔️ Customer segmentation – Understand purchasing behavior across different customer groups.<br/>
✔️ Geographical insights – Determine which locations generate the highest revenue.<br/>
✔️ Operational efficiency – Analyze shipping times and order fulfillment trends to identify potential bottlenecks.

## ✨ **Features**  
🔹 Dynamic time filtering (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, Previous Year)  
🔹 Data loading from CSV into a Spark DataFrame  
🔹 Sales trend analysis by category, region, and customer segment  
🔹 SQL queries using SparkSQL for deeper insights  

## 📌 **Usage**  
This project serves as a starting point for sales data analysis using PySpark. It can be extended with more advanced analytics, machine learning models, or visualizations.
